version 1.0 - TBD
NEW:
  Added 7 new Materials: Nickel, Lead, Zinc, Cobalt, Brass, Invar, and Neodymium.
    Nickel, Lead, and Zinc are common (like Iron).
    Cobalt is uncommon (like Silver and Gold).
    Neodymium is rare (like Platinum or Titanium).
    Brass and Invar are Metal Alloys.
      Since our alloy recipes are simple crafting recipes right now:
      - The Brass recipe is disabled if Create or GregTech is installed.
      - Invar recipe is disabled if GregTech or Thermal Foundation is installed.
  Material info and descriptions are now printed in Ingot tooltips.
   - This can be configured in the addsynth_materials.toml config file.
  Metal Blocks and Gem Blocks can now be used as Beacon Base blocks.
  Metal Ingots and Gems can now be used as Beacon fuel.
CHANGED:
  In the real world, Bronze actually has a lighter color than Copper. Changed the color of Bronze
    blocks and items to a lighter color that I've used for Copper before.
  Silicon Ore now drops 2-3 Silicon instead of just 1.
  Updated which mods disables our alloy recipes:
    Steel furnace recipe is disabled if:
      Immersive Engineering, Mekanism, GregTech, or Tinkers' Construct is installed.
    Bronze recipe is disabled if:
      GregTech, Mekanism, or Thermal Foundation is installed.
FIXED:
  Added missing Deepslate variants of all ores.
