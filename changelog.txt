version 1.0 - TBD
NEW:
  Added 7 new Materials: Nickel, Lead, Zinc, Cobalt, Brass, Invar, and Neodymium.
    Nickel, Lead, and Zinc are common (like Iron).
    Cobalt is uncommon (like Silver and Gold).
    Neodymium is rare (like Platinum or Titanium).
    Brass and Invar are Metal Alloys.
  Added missing Deepslate variants of all ores.
CHANGED:
  In the real world, Bronze actually has a lighter color than Copper. Changed the color of Bronze
    blocks and items to a lighter color that I've used for Copper before.
  Silicon Ore now drops 2-3 Silicon instead of just 1.
